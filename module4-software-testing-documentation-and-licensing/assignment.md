# Spruce up `bloomdata`

* Add at least three basic `pytest` functions to `bloomdata`
* Make sure there are docstrings wherever PEP 8 demands
* Write a high-quality `README.md` that is both skimmable and has appropriate
  examples/details/links for someone who wants to understand your code
* Pick a license for your package, and add it in a `LICENSE` file.

Please submit your `pytest` file (the one with the test) and your `README.md` to Canvas.
